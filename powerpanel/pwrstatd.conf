# device node which is occupied by other software. Therefore, you can restrict
# this enumerate behave by using allowed-device-nodes option. You can assign
# the single device node path or multiple device node paths divided by a
# semicolon at this option. All groups of 'ttyS', 'ttyUSB', 'hiddev', or
# 'libusb' device node are enumerated without a suffix number assignment.
